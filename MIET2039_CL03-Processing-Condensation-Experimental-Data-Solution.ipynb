    "A condensation experimental test was performed and both film and dropwise condensation phenemonon was produced. A vertical plate is placed in a chamber filled with hot vapour. The vertical plate has cold water running through it at a given flow rate. This produces a plate surface temperature lower than the vapour saturation temperature. Heat is absorbed by the flowing water and its temperature change is caused by the condensation heat transfer.\n",

    "In film condensation, a film layer is produced which flows downwards under gravitational force. It is this film of liquid between the surface and the vapor that produce the main resistance of heat transfer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dropwise condensation occurs when droplets form on the surface, and through merging with other bubbles can grow in size until it is sufficiently large to overcome surface tension forces and slides downwards under graviational forces. The large void regions providing direct heat transfer contact between surface and vapour, is ideal for heat exchange since it produces much higher heat transfer rates than film condensation. Unfortunately maintaining dropwise condensation is difficult because of the bubbles' propensity to grow in size and eventually flow together forming a film layer."
