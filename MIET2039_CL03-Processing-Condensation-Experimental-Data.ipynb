    "A condensation experimental test was performed and both film and dropwise condensation phenemonon was produced. A vertical plate is placed in a chamber filled with hot vapour. The vertical plate has cold water running through it at a given flow rate. This produces a plate surface temperature lower than the vapour saturation temperature. Heat is absorbed by the flowing water and its temperature change is caused by the condensation heat transfer.\n",

    "In experimental work large amounts of data sets are often gathered. Without the use of scripting tools a naive experimentalist would probably process each data file manually.
