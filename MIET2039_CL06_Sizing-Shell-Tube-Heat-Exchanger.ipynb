    "\n",
    "Water at 15<sup>o</sup>C with a mass flow rate of 8 kg/s is available to cool hot oil from 90<sup>o</sup>C to 30<sup>o</sup>C. The oil mass flow rate is 5 kg/s. A shell-and-tube heat exchanger with one-shell pass and four tube-passes is proposed for this process. Using uniform cp values of 2.5 kJ/(kg<sup>o</sup>C) and 4.2 kJ/(kg<sup>o</sup>C) for oil and water, respectively, and assuming an overall heat transfer coefficient of 250 W/(m<sup>2</sup>.<sup>o</sup>C) for the heat exchanger\n",

    "1. determine the surface area of the heat exchanger, and therefore a combination in the diameter of the pipe with its horizontal length (max. length of 20m due to limited space) per tube-pass.\n",
    "2. if more power is used to pump the water through more rapidly, a greater cooling effect will occur. Repeat by looking at the effect of the mass flow rate at 10kg/s, 20kg/s, 30kg/s on the size of the heat exchanger. The information will help if there are space constraints in installing the heat exchanger\n",
